Playground
==========

A place where I try out different stuff. It might contain traces of: 

- Java
  - Javassist (a Hello World program in /java/lu/mir/jsst/helloworld)
  - BCEL (a Hello World program generated with BCEL in /java/lu/mir/bcel/codegen)
- C (an example of decompilation which illustrates some of the optimizations compilers can make in /c/cc-decompilation/)
